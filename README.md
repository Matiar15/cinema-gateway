# Cinema-Gateway
Two enthusiasts working in symbiosis in order to gain experience
## What is Cinema-Gateway?
Cinema-gateway is a cinema system, built mainly in Kotlin. Its purpose is to give us some experience on working in group.
Everything was done by [**Matiar15**](https://github.com/Matiar15) and [**SQD.exe**](https://github.com/SQDexe) 
## What do we want to accomplish?
We want to connect two applications - cinema-gateway and ~~how tf can we name the other app~~ by creating backend (this app) and frontend app (soon to be released!)
## Details of the app
Would you like to create your **own** cinema? Add **repertoire** to it? Maybe you'd like to **create** a film or whole schedule for cinema's upcoming playing days?! Cinema-Gateway gives you **this** oportunity.
Building the app is plain and simple, you just have to (ehkm.. <- add DockerFile reference 😁) build the app with DockerFile, and include database cridentials in prod.yml file. Database migration is done automatically via Flyway.
After build, you are free to test the application!
