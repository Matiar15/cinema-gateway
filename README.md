# Cinema-Gateway
## What is Cinema-Gateway?
Cinema-gateway is a cinema system, built mainly in Kotlin. It handles creating cinemas, repertoires (day schedule), films and seat reservation for room in cinema.
Everything was done by [**Matiar15**](https://github.com/Matiar15) 
## Details of the app
Would you like to create your **own** cinema? Add **repertoire** to it? Maybe you'd like to **create** a film or whole schedule for cinema's upcoming playing days?! Cinema-Gateway gives you **this** oportunity.
Building the app is plain and simple, you just have to build the app with DockerFile, and include database cridentials when you run docker container. Database migration is done automatically via Flyway.
After build, feel free to test the application!
App also has CI/CD and push job that sends the newest build to my private repo ;)
