# Cinema-Gateway
Two enthusiasts working in symbiosis in order to gain experience
## What is Cinema-Gateway?
Cinema-gateway is a cinema system, built mainly on Kotlin. Its' purpose is to give us some experience on working in group.
Everything was done by [**Matiar15**](https://github.com/Matiar15) and [**SQD.exe**](https://github.com/SQDexe) 
## What do we want to accomplish?
We want to connect two applications - cinema-gateway and ~~how tf can we name the other app~~ by creating endpoints to let apps communicate with each other
### Endpoints 
`WIP`
